## üìÇ Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation
- **Objective:** Group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - K-Means Clustering  
  - PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)  
  - Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling  
- **Outcome:** Businesses can target marketing campaigns effectively by understanding customer groups such as high spenders, budget buyers, or occasional customers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GTRSB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)
- **Objective:** Build a computer vision model to classify German traffic signs.  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
  - Image Augmentation (rotation, scaling, flipping)  
  - TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning implementation  
- **Outcome:** Achieved a robust model for automatic traffic sign recognition, which can be integrated into driver assistance systems or autonomous vehicles.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loan Approval Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details.  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
  - Handling missing values & imbalanced data  
  - Feature engineering on categorical and numerical variables  
- **Outcome:** A predictive system that helps banks and financial institutions minimize risks by automating loan approval processes.
